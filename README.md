# Automated-Spotify-Mix-Up

Welcome to Spotify Automation!
This program will extract all the most listened to songs from each of Spotify's feature-playlists of the day. 

These are the instructions on how to get started with this program:

1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/, click on Dashboard, and register for an account.
2. Once completed, create an app, naming it whatever you want.
3. After the app is created, go to the "edit settings" button on the right side of your screen 
   and add https://example.com/callback/ to the Redirect URI section.
4. Next, download the python program code to your computer.
5. You will need to modify the source code where you see XXXX.
    * Your client ID and secret ID are both located in the app on the spotify developer site.
6. You will also need to create a new spotify playlist, then copy the URI for that playlist 
   into the source Code.
